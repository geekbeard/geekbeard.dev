> We now have the technology that can be considered to be "computer vision". It recognizes the objects, human faces, silhouettes and also can track them, add overlays that follow the objects movements. The possibilities are overwhelming!

AI... Though technically I'd love to use more specific terminology for this technological advancement - something that would underline the expansion of LLMs and growth of the scale of their "pattern matching". However, we the simplicity and dramatic accent I'll stick to AI.

## We are in the hype

If we compare it to some previous hypes, notably Metaverse / NFT “pandemic”, that had more of an emotional hype than factual value. True believers would now say: “It’s not over yet! You just wait and see, it’s coming back… soon!” - maybe, maybe it is coming back one day. But the facts now are that back then it was a burst of visions, promises, ideas, businesses which burnt through private wallets and corporate budgets like a forest fire on a hot and dry summer day. That hype raged. It was loud, it was fast. But as they say:

*If you ride like a lightning, you'll crash like a thunder.*

And boy did it crash. You wouldn't now walk into the room full of people and try to tell them something about your recept metaverse project. The crowd will slowly move away to find something more interesting to do, rather listen to "this annoying person".

AI hype is a little different. It does take your watch and empty your wallet while you are admiring it's creations, for sure, but at least the creations this time give you something back. Sometimes even a measurable value.

## AI in fashion

Fashion brands and software vendors jump onto the AI train like if Noah's Ark is leaving and it's now or never. The very potent mixture of "cool" and value converted a lot of people into prophets and believers. New section was added to the budget Excels - AI. POs issued, credit cards filled in and the money started flowing.

Currently we can round up a list of what is fashion doing with AI in general:

* sketch to photo
* model shot
* “now it’s a photo of you wearing it”
* product categorisation
* marketing material (videos)

I would like to say that the results are "amazing", but personally I think my eye got adjusted and trained through these months, years now and I would fairly just say: results are not bad and sometimes very good.

But this poses the question… 

### Is that it? 

>>>>>> to be edited below

These are “party tricks”. It’s something that yes, will/might/should help the business, speed up some operations, maybe cut some costs (or introduce new ones), maybe change some workflows. And?

If we zoom out, far away and look back at the brand that’s using and implementing all of this - what will we see? We probably still see the same brand, doing 90% same things, running same-ish way.

The point that i’m trying to make is that in recent months (probably close to a year now), after multiple discussions, thoughts, tests… I’m coming to think that while these “party tricks” have value and do change certain things in brands operations - this is not where AI going to “change fashion”. 

This, what we do with AI right now, is too simple, too traditional, too expected…Solutions made by inertia. Making the wheel rounder, the roads flatter, the tires stronger. We are NOT abandoning roads, we are NOT switching to flying, we are NOT replacing the wheels with…”gravity engines”. We are not changing the fashion at the core. We just learned some tricks.

Too early.

Reasonable thought we can share is that “it’s too early” for global shifts and changes in fashion due to AI. We need to get to the peak of our creativity mixed with the new tech capabilities. This needs to still brew a bit longer. This chemical reaction might happen by itself. And then we find, invent and create much more impactful, deeper changes in fashion with AI backing them up.

Yes… I agree. It’s early.

Though…Someone will be the first and everyone else will be AFTER. Let’s see:)
